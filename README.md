# PolicyDAO

## ðŸŒº Mission

Educate our political leaders about DAOs and work with them to help shift the narrative of crypto to being more DAO centric.

### Context

We believe there is a fundamental flaw in how regulators are talking about crypto right now. We're currently focusing too much on the token, or anon aspect of the technology, and not of the true innovation, DAOs.

We believe that DAOs have thet potential to bring real democracy and equity to our systems.

We believe that if politicians were aware of all the good that crypto is bringing about, we could create more productive legislation around DAOs and Crypto.

Our goal is to educate and work with leaders in the civic and political eco-systems to bring around that chance.
