# Contributing

We want to model the behavior we want to see out in the world. We've built this repo in a way to encourage contributions and collaborations.

To make an addition or change to this repo, we use a fork and pull model. Here's some links to learn how to do both:

- [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- [Making a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

If you aren't sure where to start, submit an issue and we'll try to respond to you their!
