# PolicyDAO


## DAO Formation Meeting - 03/08/2022

Current State:
- Terra has already raised around ~$100k of funding via grants from ecosystem projectst (min. $250k needed to kick off)
- treat as initial kickstarter (PR campaign)
    - contract PR work out to firm or bring in firm employees into DAO and have them work directly

Wants:
- Raise more money to reach funding goals
- **Question:**  How do we balance all the different stakeholders

Groups of Stakeholders:
Ideally, stakeholders do not expect financial returns (impact KPIs?) but maintain flexible exit rights   
1. Institutions who gave money without expectations of righst (sponsors / NFTs)
2. Institutions or individuals who will be partners and active worker (members)
3. Yeeters (individuals or institutions) that will want some kind of "shares" but aren't full members. (looters)


Proposed Structure:
- Current amount raised from institutions => Goes into a vault
    - Potentially give all instutitutions, regardless of size of donation, a single loot or vote share (put cap on donation size?)
    - rolling funding (expecting instituions to give money regularly/multiple times)

Next Steps:
- Manually create DAO 
    - Connect with team at yeet.daohaus.club: join Yeet list, fill out form, work with team to set up
